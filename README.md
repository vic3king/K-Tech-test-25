# K Technical Assessment

## üìù Summary

For this assessment I went with the monorepo approach as I believe it to be a good starting point for our application but also giving us the flexibility to scale in gradual maintainable steps as each folder in this mono repo can be extracted and run independently.

On the backend you will find a clear separation of different components/modules required to run a highly scalable and efficient REST API using the repository pattern with information flowing from client -> controller -> middleware -> service -> repository -> db each part making use of various smaller patterns like Single Responsibility and DI which is most commonly used.

As of today we have two main endpoints with one not being used on the frontend. Our app is more focused on the GET /comms/your-next-delivery/:userId endpoint. This endpoint on frontend component mount uses Axios and react Query to fetch our data from the backend. I slightly modified the response object to include cats information which I needed to display a more complete details modal.

On the backend I focused on solving the templating problem. To achieve this I had many options one of which involved using regex to find and update my templates strings with real data, but I felt that would not have been easily readable and would prove hard to maintain in the long run. So I went with Handlebars as preferred templating engine which is a robust and wel maintained package for handling templates.

Information on this endpoint flows from a client request to my controller which talks to my comms service and the comms service talking to my templating engine which in  turn gets the right template to use from a repository/db model for templates. I decided to handle templates as its own entity because in the future changes will be made to these templates and new templates will likely be added. This approach means we can make these updates and changes to our templates without having to make a code change or deployment.

I also added:
- Swagger documentation
- Robust test suites covering unit tests and integration tests
- Security middleware (Helmet)
- Cookie parser for proper JSON data handling

Future improvements could include:
- Better cat management system(CRUD)
- Ability to modify and or extend pricing data management for pouch sizes
- Media management for our furry friends
- Standardized template approach (e.g., use of <> vs {{}})
- Dynamic delivery date handling(currently hardcoded to 2 days)
- Notification tracking system(When was it last sent? retries etc)
- CI/CD pipeline
- Containerized app
- Authentication system etc

The frontend is a simple single page app built using Next.js and Tailwind. It uses a custom hook for data fetching which is an abstraction of react query and axios.

This app has components for:
- Delivery Card (Main page)
- Delivery Card Error
- Skeleton loader
- React Query and Axios setup for data fetching

  - API Swagger Documentation: `http://localhost:4000/docs`
- Frontend runs on: `http://localhost:3000`

### Running the Project

#### Option 1: Using the Shell Script (Recommended)
1. Make the script executable and run it:
   ```bash
   chmod +x run-app.sh
   ./run-app.sh
   ```
   This will automatically:
   - Install dependencies for both frontend and backend
   - Start the backend server on port 4000
   - Start the frontend server on port 3000
   - Kill any existing processes on these ports

#### Option 2: Manual Setup

##### Backend
1. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server
   ```bash
   npm run start:dev
   ```

##### Frontend
1. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
